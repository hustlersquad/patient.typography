# Chest infection

Chest infections are very common, especially in autumn and winter. Chest infections can be serious and need urgent treatment. However, **many chest infections in otherwise healthy people do not need antibiotic medicines** and get better quite quickly. If you feel very unwell then you should see a doctor urgently to see what treatment you need.

## Can I prevent a chest infection?
There are measures you can take to help prevent chest infection and to stop the spread of it to others. You can pass a chest infection on to others through coughing and sneezing. So if you have a chest infection, it's important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze and to wash your hands regularly. Throw away used tissues immediately.

Immunisation against the pneumococcus germ (bacterium) - the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia - and the annual flu (influenza) virus immunisation are advised if you are at increased risk of developing these infections. See separate leaflets called [Pneumococcal Immunisation](https://patient.info/health/pneumococcal-immunisation) and [Influenza Immunisation](https://patient.info/health/influenza-immunisation) for more details.

### What should I do to treat myself?
If you have a chest infection, you should:

* Have plenty of rest.
* Drink lots of fluid to prevent your body becoming lacking in fluids (dehydrated) and to help keep the mucus in your lungs thin
* Inhale steam vapour, perhaps with added menthol. This can help to clear the mucus from your chest.
